    - Albert Cho
    - USC Minsitry Leader
    - Upon graduation of high school, God sovereignly led Albert to Los Angeles, California
      to attend USC from his hometown of Houston, Texas. At USC, where he began to
      develop a deeper relationship with God. Blessed by discipleship and training,
      Albert decided to become a campus leader at USC to pass on the blessings he
      received as an undergrad while simultaneously beginning to work full-time as
      a software engineer at DIRECTV. Albert's childhood dream was to become a professional
      basketball player, but he decided to settle as an engineer when he stopped growing
      at 5'8". To anyone gullible enough, Albert likes to tell tales about his pet
      horse and the dirt roads of Texas.

    - Brenda Lee
    - USC Women's Ministry Leader
    - Brenda came to USC ICA during her freshman year. Throughout her undergrad years,
      which was a pivotal time of being humbled by God and finding her identity in
      Christ, she continually experienced the depths of God's love for her, and began
      to see the importance of a life-long commitment to pursuing and following God
      above all else, as well as the importance of passing on this conviction to others
      through discipleship and evangelism. She is currently a 2nd year graduate dental
      student at USC and hopes to use dentistry in the future to care for and minister
      to patients, whether in a local or overseas setting. In her free time, she likes
      to go to the cinema, play badminton/piano, eat sweets, and spend time with friends
      and family.

      in the footsteps of Jesus Christ by preaching, teaching, and healing. This promise
      has led him from USC to Mongolia to Taiwan, with plenty of opportunities to
      teach, preach, and heal along the way. A recent graduate from USC who studied
      biology and Chinese, he is generally considered by his brothers and sisters
      to be a "character," but he''s still unsure whether his scooter, his penchant
      for quips and one-liners, or his obsession with trivia is responsible for such
      a reputation.'

      she saw, for the first time, the magnitude of God's love for her and His unique
      ability to fill and satisfy her in every way. Armed with these transforming
      truths and a persevering spirit, Jen spent the remainder of her undergrad years
      growing in her relationship with God and seeking His will for her life. Now,
      having graduated, she works full-time while also serving in the ministry at

      the Bible on his own through a time of struggle. He became a part of our sister
      ministry in UC Berkeley, where he received his Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering.
      During that time he came to a greater understanding of God's love and also God's
      call to discipleship. After graduating, he came to UCLA to get his Master's
      in EE and support our Bruin ICA ministry. Always willing to lend a helping hand,
      Jack's spiritual upbringing at Cal makes him an excellent shepherd and brings
      a fresh perspective among his brothers and sisters. In his spare time, he likes

    - Elaine Wong
    - UCLA Women's Ministry Leader
    - Elaine didn't grow up having a Christian background. Her mom used to be a strong
      Buddhist, while her dad had no religion. She herself didn't have any religion,
      but believed in a higher being. In junior high, in a dark time of her and her
      family's life, she called out to God from the bottom of her heart, and God saved
      her and her family, showing her that He was there and true and did a 180 change
      in her family's life. Elaine, her mom, and her sister all came to know Christ.
      Ever since that time, Elaine knew she wanted to live for God and His will. She
      is now a PhD student at UCLA, Environmental Engineering major with an emphasis
      in water treatment, and a teaching assistant at UCLA. She loves to dance, disciple,
      pray, eat good food, and have quality time with her friends and husband.

      but soon realized that there is much more to life than what society so often

      in 2012, it became clear to Josh that he ought to make his relationship with
      God a priority in his life. Since then he has become a part of the  UCLA servants
      team, leads Bible studies, and meets up with those who are interested in learning
      more about Christianity. Apart from spending time serving the ministry, Josh
      enjoys playing sports as well as playing and listening to music.

    - Caleb Molitoris
    - UCI Ministry Leader
    - As a missionary's kid, Caleb was exposed to Christianity at a young age. Having
      been raised in Lutheran churches and schools, Caleb had a solid understanding
      of who Jesus is and what He taught. However, he did not experience the blessings
      of having a personal relationship with Christ until his college years at UCLA.
      Because he was blessed by those who poured into him while he was a student,
      Caleb was moved to personally invest in the lives of people. Caleb graduated
      from UCLA with a BS in electrical engineering in 2012, and is now working at
      Intel while serving as associate assistant director at UCI ICA.

    - Elaine Wong
    - UCI Women's Ministry Leader
    - Elaine didn't grow up having a Christian background. Her mom used to be a strong
      Buddhist, while her dad had no religion. She herself didn't have any religion,
      but believed in a higher being. In junior high, in a dark time of her and her
      family's life, she called out to God from the bottom of her heart, and God saved
      her and her family, showing her that He was there and true and did a 180 change
      in her family's life. Elaine, her mom, and her sister all came to know Christ.
      Ever since that time, Elaine knew she wanted to live for God and His will. She
      is now a PhD student at UCLA, Environmental Engineering major with an emphasis
      in water treatment, and a teaching assistant at UCLA. She loves to dance, disciple,
      pray, eat good food, and have quality time with her friends and husband.

    - Akemi Furuyama
    - Rutgers Women's Ministry Leader

      forward to supporting her husband in ministry and meeting up with sisters in
      Christ.  She enjoys spending time with her family, taking pictures, and baking.
