					If there’s a concept that’s central to our ministry in ICA, it would be the concept of one-on-one discipleship: That God has called us to make disciples and grow their faith so that they would be able to make disciples in turn.
				</p>
				<p class = "indent discipleship-arial">
					How did you get here on earth? The answer is quite simple: You were born from a mother and a father, both of whom were born themselves from your grandparents, who were also birthed by a set of parents. The origins of our spiritual lives are much the same. Every Christian became a Christian as the result of a person who preached the Gospel to them and helped them grow, and that person was himself descended from another Christian. This concept of spiritual reproduction is one of the major components of discipleship, and its origins are age-old. In fact, God’s call for reproduction, both physical and spiritual, was made after creating the world and everything in it: “Be fruitful and multiply” (Genesis 1:28).

			The second component of discipleship involves bringing the new disciple to a point of spiritual maturity. Although our spiritual walk is one of continual growth over our entire lives, the benchmark for spiritual maturity in the context of discipleship is the ability to spiritually reproduce and make a new generation of disciples. Just as one can trace their family’s generations, one can also trace their own spiritual generations of disciples who were faithful to Jesus’ Great Commission to “make disciples of all nations, baptizing them...and teaching them to obey everything that [Christ] commanded” (Matthew 28:19). The concept of spiritual generations is vital to the idea of discipleship, because it provides the goal and focus for a person’s spiritual maturation.

				Based on these Biblical imperatives, in ICA we engage in one-on-one discipleship, where an older brother or sister iscommitted to maturing a younger brother or sister to be able to disciple others themselves. This goes far beyond a mentorship during your four-year college career: It’s a lifelong friendship and an active training that persists until spiritual maturity.
