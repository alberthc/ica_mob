          In Christ Alone Ministry is an non-denominational, non-profit organization whose purpose has simply been "to worship God and make Christ's love known." We love Jesus, we love each other, we love studying the Bible and praying together as a family of believers, and we love proclaiming our witness to the power and goodness of the Word and Jesus' name to others.
        </p>    
        <p>
          Our mission is this: To advance the gospel of Jesus
          and His Kingdom into the nations, mainly through equipping
          spiritual generations of labourers living among those who do
          not know Christ so they can be disciples and disciple-
          makers anywhere. 
        </p>

    <div class="misstateright large-6 small-12 columns">
      <p>
        We are compelled by the love we've experienced from
      Jesus to go out and invite more people to share in our joy of
      fellowship with Christ. Through discipleship and unity in faith,
      we desire to make true followers after Jesus who would demonstrate Christ's character and devotion and bring glory and
      worship to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we learn to be faithful followers of Jesus in our daily
      lives, we want to pass on the knowledge and wisdom of what
      we've learned to younger generations, to also see them
      become spiritual leaders and genuine disciples and continue
      passing on the knowledge of Christ wherever they go. We want
      to make Christ's love known to all the nations.
