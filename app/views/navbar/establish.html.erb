    <h3><strong>What is Establishing?</strong></h3>
    <p class="indent">Before a disciple is able to be spiritually mature, they must be “rooted and established in [Christ]” (Colossians 2:7). A disciple must have a living, devoted relationship with God through actively enjoying the word of God and prayer. As a disciple grows in experiencing God’s love and grace, they become a “new creation” (2 Corinthians 5:17), becoming more and more like Christ. These changes become readily apparent in their Christlike character, their victory over sin, and their capacity to love and serve others.</p>

    <h3>The Wheel Illustration</h3>
    <p class="indent">The Spirit-filled follower of Christ keeps Christ in the center of his life. In order to keep Christ as the center, the follower must have a steady balance of the Word, prayer, fellowship, and witnessing. These areas should exhibit themselves in a life of obedience to Christ. We share the Wheel Illustration to show believers how they can keep Christ the center of their lives.</p>

    <h3>The Word Hand</h3>
    <p class="indent">Did you know that there's more to experience of God's Word than simply hearing and reading it? In order to get a full experience of His Word, we must listen, read, study, memorize, and meditate. The Word Hand is an illustration we use to share with believers about the importance of each of these 5 aspects to experiencing God's Word. When we are established in all 5 of these areas, we are able to hold tightly onto God's Word so that it cannot be snatched away.</p>
