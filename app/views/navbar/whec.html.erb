					Bringing together people from our different campus ministries and White Harvest Evangelical Church, praise night is an opportunity to worship and enjoy God corporately. At praise nights, we have a chance to fellowship with one another participating in fun activities. After worship is a time reserved for quiet individual prayer. Come join us as we give the Lord the glory due His name and experience times of refreshing!
